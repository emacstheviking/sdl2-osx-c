# SDL2 Programming with "C" for OS X

Actually if you have enough skills to install the libraries on Windows
or Linux and make it compile and link, the code presented should work
on those platforms too, that's the beauty of SDL.

# Aims

To provide simple working code that doesn't get in the way of you trying
to learn lots of things at once.

As I write more posts over time I will always update this repository with
the code from the posts. The code here will probably be a little more
commented and maybe have some extra bits. This is deliberate as I have strived
to keep the actual post as simple as possible.

# Summary

As with most things, the initial confrontation with something new can at
times be very frustrating so I would recommend you:

  - install a C compiler and write a simple hello world.
  - install the SDL2 libraries and header files for your platform.
  - follow 01-basic-window from here:

# Lesson Plan

  01. The first lesson shows you how to code a very small application that will
  test the compiler and linker work OK with SDL2.

  02. Simple keyboard handling via minimal SDL2 event loop. Handles SDL_QUIT.

  03. Minimal rendering example to draw a simple box that responds to keyboard
      input to move it around.

Good luck in your coding!
